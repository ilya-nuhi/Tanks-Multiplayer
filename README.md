# Knot's Resolutions
I have developed this game in 48 hours for the contest of bogazici game jam with my teammates burak, who is an artist, and yusuf,  who is a composer.  
It's a 2d puzzle game. Our character is tied with a rope and rope has a length to extend.  
Player should untie knots in the map and extend rope length to find the exit.
# Command Keys
WASD -> moving  
space -> jump (also used for deattaching and jumping from swinging)  
left shift -> backdash  
mouse button 1 -> attack with whip  
E -> attach a swing point, deattach a swing point
